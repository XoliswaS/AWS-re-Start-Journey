The Generative AI for Decision Makers course introduced me to how generative AI works and how organizations use it to 
improve productivity,innovation, and decision-making.
I learned the core concepts behind models like large language models, their capabilities and limitations,
and the importance of responsible AI. The course also explained how leaders choose the right AI tools, manage risks,
and use generative AI to automate tasks, support teams, and drive business value.



Overall, this learning helped me understand how generative AI supports smarter decisions and
how it can be applied in real solutions.
