The AI Practitioner Learning Plan introduced me to the foundations of Artificial Intelligence, 
including how AI works, where it is used, and how it is applied in real-world scenarios. 
I learned the key concepts of machine learning, generative AI, responsible AI practices, data basics, and
how AI tools can assist in solving business problems. The learning plan also covered how cloud services support AI,
and how AI models are built, deployed, and used in applications.

Overall,this training strengthened my understanding of AI fundamentals and helped me gain confidence in 
how AI and cloud technology work together.
